Manual installation:

1. Download BepInEx 5.4.21 and copy it into your Thronefall directory.
2. You must run the game once before proceeding.

Thunderstore:

I highly recommend using Thunderstore to install this mod. r2modman supports Thronefall profiles and allows you to install, disable and uninstall mods quickly and easily.

# Application
The SetDayTimer mod was made specifically for the donner's dungeon Thronefall Tournament. It makes the game harder by giving you a limited amount of time during the day to build / upgrade your castle.
No other aspect of the game is changed by this mod.

# Modification
Currently, I have no way of letting you modify the time limit for each day, you would need to edit the code yourself. I may look into this after the tournament.
