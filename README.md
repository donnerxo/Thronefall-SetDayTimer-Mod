# Thronefall-SetDayTimer-Mod
This mod limits the amount of 'daytime' you have, giving you less time to build thus making the game harder.
Please note: [Thronefall SetDayTimer Mod](https://github.com/donnerxo/Thronefall-SetDayTimer-Mod/) is not yet finished and requires extensive testing.

# Installation
Using Thunderstore:

I highly recommend using [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/thronefall/) to install this mod. r2modman supports Thronefall profiles and allows you to install, disable and uninstall mods quickly and easily.

1. Download and open r2modman and create a Thronefall profile.
   (You may need to open the game in modded mode once at this stage if it doesn't let you do the next step)
2. Download and install BepInEx
3. You must run the game once in modded mode at this stage, so that BepInEx can properly install.
4. Download the Thronefall SetDayTimer Mod
5. Run the modded version of the game from your r2modman profile and enjoy!

Manual Installation:

1. Install [BepInEx](https://thunderstore.io/c/thronefall/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack_Thronefall/)
2. Run and close the game once before proceeding.
3. Download and extract Thronefall SetDayTime Mod anywhere but **not into game folder**.
4. Move everything from the extracted mod folder to the the 'Plugins' folder within the 'BepInEx' folder.
5. Run the game and enjoy!

Quick Debug: If your game crashes on the third night, a quick re-install of the mod should fix it. Otherwise, please have a look in the [Thronefall Discord](https://discord.gg/gVYctptyg8) #game-mods channel or get in touch with donnertm.

# Application
The SetDayTimer mod was made specifically for a purpose I cannot yet reveal. It makes the game harder by giving you a limited amount of time during the day to build / upgrade your castle.
No other aspect of the game is changed by this mod.

# Modification
Currently, I have no way of letting you modify the time limit for each day, you would need to edit the code yourself.
