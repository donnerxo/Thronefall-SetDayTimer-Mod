# Thronefall-SetDayTimer-Mod
This mod limits the amount of 'daytime' you have and will be used for the donner's dungeon Thronefall Tournament.

# Installation
Thunderstore:

I highly recommend using Thunderstore to install this mod. r2modman supports Thronefall profiles and allows you to install, disable and uninstall mods quickly and easily.

1. Download r2modman and create a Thronefall profile.
2. You must run the game at least once before proceeding.
3. Download BepInEx and Thronefall SetDayTimer Mod.
4. Run the modded game from your r2modman profile and enjoy!

# Application
The SetDayTimer mod was made specifically for the donner's dungeon Thronefall Tournament. It makes the game harder by giving you a limited amount of time during the day to build / upgrade your castle.
No other aspect of the game is changed by this mod.

# Modification
Currently, I have no way of letting you modify the time limit for each day, you would need to edit the code yourself. I may look into this after the tournament.
